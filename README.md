# 🎯 ArcheryVR 

I built while learning the basics of VR development. I made it for the **Oculus Quest 2**, and it’s been a fun way for me to dip my toes into VR. Here is the tutorial that i followed for the bow and arrow mechanism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHkAl-fVa1A

## 🌟 About the Project
ArcheryVR is a super basic VR game where you can grab a bow, shoot arrows, and try to hit a target that’s placed on moving platforms. The closer you hit to the center of the target, the more points you get! The platforms move randomly to make things a bit harder, and there’s a score UI to keep track of your points. I built this project to learn the fundamentals of VR in Unity, so it’s nothing fancy—just a fun experiment while I figure things out.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Engine:** Unity - 2022.3.55f1
- **Dependency:**  XR Interaction Toolkit
- **VR Platform:**  Oculus Quest 2

## 📖 What I Learned 

- **VR Development**: I got hands-on with Unity’s VR setup, learning how to manage cameras, controllers, and interactions in a 3D space.
- **UX Design**: I started thinking about how players experience VR—small tweaks like visual feedback (e.g., glowing particles) and clear tooltips made the game more intuitive.
- **Feedback Matters**: Adding audio cues and visual effects (like a score popup) made every shot feel rewarding.
- **Performance Basics**: I learned to balance visuals with optimization, especially for a standalone device like the Quest 2.

(and some archery for sure!)
