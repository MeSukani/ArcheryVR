# ðŸŽ¯ ArcheryVR 

Hey there! Welcome to **ArcheryVR**, a simple VR archery game I built while learning the basics of VR development. I made it for the **Oculus Quest 2**, and itâ€™s been a fun way for me to dip my toes into VR. The game lets you shoot arrows at a target placed on moving platforms to score pointsâ€”kind of like a VR archery range with a little challenge thrown in!

## ðŸŒŸ About the Project
ArcheryVR is a super basic VR game where you can grab a bow, shoot arrows, and try to hit a target thatâ€™s placed on moving platforms. The closer you hit to the center of the target, the more points you get! The platforms move randomly to make things a bit harder, and thereâ€™s a score UI to keep track of your points. I built this project to learn the fundamentals of VR in Unity, so itâ€™s nothing fancyâ€”just a fun experiment while I figure things out.

## Gameplay Preview
Hereâ€™s a quick look at what the game looks like:
